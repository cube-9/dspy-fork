The search results provide a good overview of different SaaS pricing models and deal structures commonly used, with several relevant examples. This includes information on flat rate pricing, usage-based pricing, tiered pricing, freemium models, and more. There are also some tips on how to structure pricing and packages to optimize for growth.

However, the results don't directly provide a large number of deal term examples with variations and misspellings that could be used as training data. The information is more conceptual rather than a dataset of specific examples.
